# Deep Learning Experiments

My solutions for Stanford's [UFLDL Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial).

## Sparse Autoencoder

Back propagation algorithm applied to neural networks.

Full readings and file dependencies refer to [Exercise:Sparse Autoencoder](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Exercise:Sparse_Autoencoder).

Note: This implementation of sparse autoencoder has already been vectorized, there is also an unvectorized implementation commented out in the code file.

## Softmax Regression

Use softmax regression to build a softmax classifier for handwritten digits classification or other classification problems.

Full readings and file dependencies refer to [Exercise:Softmax Regression](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Exercise:Softmax_Regression).

## Self Taught Learning

Use sparse autoencoder to extract features from the original input data, these features are then fed into a softmax classifier for classification.

Full readings and file dependencies refer to [Exercise:Self-Taught Learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Exercise:Self-Taught_Learning).
